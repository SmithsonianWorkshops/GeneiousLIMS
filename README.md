# Geneious Software and LIMS Plugin
This GitHub repository hosts the materials used in the Smithsonian Institution workshop: **Geneious Software and LIMS Plugin**

The purpose of the workshop is to provide intensive training for Geneious software and the associated LIMS plugin. We will be demonstrating the pipeline that CBOL developed for SI Barcode Network projects, but we are opening it to the entire Smithsonian community. We will show how any Sanger sequencing project can use the same system to organize their lab workflows and data. 

Slides, in-class materials, and links to recordings can be found in each Session folder.
