# Geneious Software and LIMS Plugin
This GitHub repository hosts the materials used in the Smithsonian Institution workshop: **Geneious Software and LIMS Plugin**

The purpose of the workshop is to provide intensive training for Geneious software and the associated LIMS plugin. We will be demonstrating the pipeline that CBOL developed for SI Barcode Network projects, but we are opening it to the entire Smithsonian community. We will show how any Sanger sequencing project can use the same system to organize their lab workflows and data.

## Resources

Everything we covered in class (and more) is covered in the SI Barcode Network Informatics ReadTheDocs page here: [SIBarcodeNetwork.rtfd.org](http://sibarcodenetwork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

The [Biocode LIMS Wiki page](https://github.com/biocodellc/biocode-lims/wiki)  contains the official documentation for the Geneious Biocode Plug-in.

The Smithsonian provides a floating institutional license for 25 concurrent users. You can find instructions for how to connect to this floating license here: [http://darwin.si.edu/about/LAB%20Documents/Geneious%20and%20Sequencher%20install.pdf](http://darwin.si.edu/about/LAB%20Documents/Geneious%20and%20Sequencher%20install.pdf). **Note: This is a Smithsonian Intranet site, so you can only connect to it on a Smithsonian network.**
